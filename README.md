CourseLookUp is a website which you can use to help with e-education. It can be used to look through different courses to find one on a subject you like.
The code gets its information from webscraping the internet. For now it only goes through Coursera and youtube, and only 10 categories have been created for the prototype.

## Usage

1. ```pip install requirments.txt```
2. ```python manage.py runserver```

To deploy to heroku, go to the bottom of settings.py and uncomment the line at the bottom of the file. Then run the normal steps to run it on Heroku.
